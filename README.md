The purpose of this report is to document the development process and key features of a Used Car Website Project. The project aims to create a user-friendly website where users can search, view, and inquire about used cars available for sale. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it aims to provide a seamless and engaging experience for both car buyers and sellers.
